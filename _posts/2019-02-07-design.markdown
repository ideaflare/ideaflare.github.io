In Joe Armstrong's [thesis on Erlang](http://erlang.org/download/armstrong_thesis_2003.pdf), he prefaces another vague definition of software architecture with a quote:

> There is no standard, universally-accepted definition of the term, for software architecture is a field in its infancy...
> While there is no standard definition, there is also no shortage of them ...
> *-The Carnegie Mellon Institute of Software Engineers*

*"Software Architecture"* is used to talk about how things are put together.

The metaphor for architecture places a strong emphasis on structure. In the physical world, there is a significant difference between a triangle with a flat surface at the bottom, or at the top. Decisions affects structural integrity, usability, costs and aesthetics.

An.. 

In software, the analogy doesn't translate entirely well. An idea of qualitative decisions is implied *(e.g. ["fundamental structural choices which are costly to change once implemented"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_architecture))*, but our main focus isn't communicated.

There is a better word for what we intend when we talk about this.

> "A set of things working together" *(i.e. System)*

boxes and arrows.

What we want to convey is:
  * Flow of information through the system 
  * Qualities of the system components: (e.g. Testability, Security, stability scalability, etc..)
