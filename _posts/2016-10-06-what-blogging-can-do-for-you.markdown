* Save your thoughts 
Blogging is a great place to put your thoughts so that you can re-visit them later. It's there so you can't forget it.

* Verbalize/Writing your ideas clarifies them
Many times when you actually tell someone about what your'e thinking, when you have to have to put it into words - you think about the idea in a slightly different way, somehow helping you to better understand it yourself. funny magic :)

* Repeat yourself less
If you find yourself sharing the same concepts in conversations, or getting asked about the same thing - you can share a link to your blog! 

* Help others
Your blog can find a place for people to discover a helpful introduction into something new, or provoke thought to get the gears rolling about some idea(s).
