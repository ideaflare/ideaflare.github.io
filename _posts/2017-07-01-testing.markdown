# Why test

Most important thing about code is that it works as expected. Testing is to validate assumptions.

# Testing Helps you to think about what you don't, so you can focus on the change you make.
## Refactoring
Helps to make sure that other code doesn't break, and enables you to refactor freely.
## Collaboration
You might not know what code is calling what, especially if multiple people are modifying the code base all the time.



### Interesting spin on the testing pyramid:
2 birds:
 * Easy to maintain tests, mostly unit.
 * Great real-time monitoring for useful information radiators
 
By using monitoring as a testing tool in a staged deployment dev->test->prod release process.
If you have a great monitoring system, you can spend less effort on hard-to-maintain integration & systems tests.
